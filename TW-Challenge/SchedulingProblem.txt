Our recruiter wants to do a scheduling of the interview process. 

There are n attendees, m interviewers and r rooms. An interview lasts 2 hours. 
A day starts at 9:00am, ends at 6:00pm with a break of one hour, at 2:00pm to 3:00pm. 

AIM:
The aim of the program is to schedule interviews in a room without overlapping timings. 

CONSTRAINT:
An interview is scheduled if there is an interviewer, an attendant and an available room. 
If we are not able to fit all the interviews before the day ends, accommodate as many as you can in the day and print a message mentioning attendees who could not be interviewed.
